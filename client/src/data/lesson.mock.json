    { "h": "What is Orbit?", "p": "You are a Royal Chainwright Apprentice. Orbit is a customizable L3 atop Arbitrum L2; RPC & chainId identify the kingdom's trade route." },
    { "h": "Why ERC-20 first?", "p": "Fungible coin standard—widest support across wallets/bridges/DEXs. Fastest path to your first successful mint." },
    { "h": "Token parameters", "p": "Name (crest), Symbol (mint mark), Decimals (granularity), Initial Supply (first treasury mint), Owner (treasurer). Human amount → wei is handled by the script." },
    { "h": "How it runs", "p": "The guild's workbench (UI) forges YAML + a deploy script. Signing is local via .env. The web never collects your keys." }
